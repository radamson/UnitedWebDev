# United Web Dev

This project is a Stack overflow clone, implementing CRUD pattern in react.js. It is a platform to unite web devolopers of all levels to share their knowledge, bring clarity to though questions and be exposed to different thinking processes.

# Server

The app is served by a custom Rails API on the backend that can be found at this repo: <a href="https://github.com/vanessuniq/rails-qa-engine-api">Rails QA Engine API</a>

# Technology

React, React-Router, React-s-Alert, Redux, Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome

# Authentication System

React Redux: JWT Authentication

# Features

*** User registration and login
*** Create, retrieve, update, and delete questions/answers
*** Like/reaction button
*** Search bar to find users by username
*** Dropdown and filter buttons to filter questions by topic, likes or unanswered 

# Accomplishment

*** Built a fully functional CRUD Rails API connected to a PostgreSQL Database
*** Fetched data from the rails API using react life-cycle methods
*** Used Redux for state management
*** Used React-Router to implement a routing system to keep UI in sync with the URL
*** Implemented user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
*** Implement an alert system using react-s-Alert to alert users of the success or failure of the action taken
*** Styled the app with Tailwind CSS

# Deployment

Deployed to heroku: https://unitedwebdev.herokuapp.com/

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
